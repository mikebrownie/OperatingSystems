# Operating Systems PAs
A collection of programming assignments (PAs) completed for The Notorious Operating Systems course at CU Boulder.

## What's included?
### PA1 
How to compile and install a modern Linux kernel, as well as how to add a couple of custom system calls.
### PA2
This assignment consists of three parts. 
- First, you will compile, install, and run a simple Loadable Kernel Module (LKM). 
- Second, you will write your own LKM that implements a basic device driver. 
- Finally, you will write a user-space test program to test the functionality of your device driver.
### PA3
Multi-threaded application, written in C, that resolves domain names to IP addresses. A solution to "The bounded buffer problem."
-  Utilizes two types of worker threads: requesters and resolvers. 
- These threads communicate with each other using a shared array, also referred to as a bounded buffer.
